Generate Binary Strings Without Consecutive 1s

Given an integer n, return all binary strings of length n that do not contain consecutive 1s. Return the result in lexicographically increasing order.



A binary string is a string consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.


Examples:
Input: n = 3

Output: ["000", "001", "010", "100", "101"]

Explanation: All strings are of length 3 and do not contain consecutive 1s.

Input: n = 2

Output: ["00", "01", "10"]

Input: n = 1

["0"]
["0", "1"]
